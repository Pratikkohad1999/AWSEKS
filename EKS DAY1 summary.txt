2. EKS is a AWS service that is used to manage cluster on the top of AWS cloud.
3. Eksctl cmd-launching and destroying a cluster on a single click 
4. kubelet:- Manages the control plane components.(executes instruction)

10.ELB is a purpose built service for distributing workloads.Elastic Load Balancing scales traffic to an application as demand changes over time. 
11. Various cmd  are as follows:-
>kubectl expose deployment myweb  --type=LoadBalancer --port=80
